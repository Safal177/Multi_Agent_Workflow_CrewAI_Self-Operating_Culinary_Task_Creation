# Workflow Title:
Multi-Agent Workflow using CrewAI for Self-Operating Culinary Task Creation

# Overview:
•	CrewAI used for a team of agents’ communication is applicable for making independent AI workflows.
•	Agents can communicate tasks, synchronize knowledge, and yield reliable outputs.
•	one example to support CrewAI self-operating AI pipeline included. 
•	This project illustrates how AI carries a real-world multi-agent workflow in practical scenarios.  

# Underlying Technologies:
•	Python programming
•	Google Colab
•	OpenAI: gpt-4o-mini as LLM 
•	CrewAI used for multi-actor workflow including task conversation under the LLM infrastructure
•	Query Engineering under LLM

# Mission:
•	Make self-managed multi-agent system and run it.
•	Communicate between agents to make personalized recipes by keeping food preference rules.
•	Make logical decisions with a simple example using CrewAI’s flow pipeline.
•	Reproducible output received.

# Notable Points:
•	Created a multi-agent workflow under CrewAI. 
•	culinary_agent working as LLM agent can understand how to manage food elements, nutritional restrictions, and user preferences.
•	Organized tasks through multiple ways: recipe planning, tuning, and result presentation.
•	Presented self-directed engine using agentic logic and AI query structuring.  
•	AI pipelines working under NLP fields. 

# Final Thoughts:
•	CrewAI is used to make Agentic AI systems which can show decision autonomy with adaptive task coordination.
•	Successfully made multi-agent workflows pipeline.
•	LLM decision-making is integrated with applied AI systems within multi-agent control.
•	Project is usable for data science/data analytic/NLP/LLM/AI engineering.
